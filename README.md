# Nft-Mixer
A minimalist nft mixer in Python

##How to use it ##

Basically the only arguments that have to change are 
ABI---> The abi should be parsed if you import from a file
Contract Address ---> The address of the contract in the blockchain
Account that makes the querys ---> Public account doesn't matter if don't have ether in it
Http_provider---> You can use moralis , infura or ur own node ( http://(ur provider)


###Improvements to do###

Modify the file , to iterate to a directory instead of only give numbers
  -So this was made in a rush , so basically it changes all of the filename to the traits to make it work
  
 ----Note---
 This works directly calling the contract to have the random traits , there are many fast harcode but only eliminate the conditonals and it should work 
 With the token_traits of the contract.
